# Cobalt
Cobalt is a project I'm currently working on to replicate and simulate a digital society and economy. 
I am by no means a professional, this is just something that I'm working on in my free time. It's more of a learning tool for myself than anything else.
If you have any 
You're free to download this if you want but please do not distribute it to anyone else, Lead them to this git page.

# NOTE!
When you download the project move it to C:\Program Files! You must do this manually for now until I write a program to do it for you.
If it's not in that directory it won't work properly, as I stated before, I am far from a professional so for now the Directories are hardcoded in the script.

# Current Features

- You can create an AI manually or run the simulation to- well simulate the the society.
- AIs have random names from a database I, painfully, put together with over 100 first and last names(for now).
- AI can also get married, for now each marriage is saved in a new folder to prevent replication of family names.
- There's no working economy fully implemented yet but bots can get jobs and earn money.
- View a bot at anytime either by visiting the files and manually openeing their .cbinfo files, or viewing them with the !view command in the console.
- Random news articles from the virtual day appear every once and a while. Each day is 10 seconds long and each year is a little over an hour, this too is hardcoded in for the time being.
- tbh it's kinda boring but I'm working on it, it's still interesting watching and reading the random events that each bot does/encounters every day lol

# Planned Features

- Fully functional Economy, aka an actual money pool all the bots pull from and contribute to so the money re-circulates.
- Customizable attributes such as day length, console color, custom names, starting money in the economy, and other attributes of the simulation.
- Age specific actions. i.e A 1 year old isn't going to "Be looking at colleges" lol.
- Some other random stuff that I'm gonna keep secret for the time, some of them are pretty interesting and I wouldn't want to spoil it!

# Other Notes
Please don't mock my script... It's messy and could be simlified but I'm in the process of cleaning it up and optimizing it, I just wanted to get it working first.
And don't expect it to be some kind of super program that is super detailed and intricate, I literally whipped this bad boy up in a few days so don't expect much when looking at the code, there will be many "Why is that there?" or "What on earth does this do?".

Basically look at your own risk :)
